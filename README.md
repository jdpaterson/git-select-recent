# git-select-recent
Quickly switch between recent git branches

To get it working:

Save the file somewhere, reference it in your ```~/.bash_profile``` as

```
alias recent="...yourpath..."
```

go into any git repo, type ```recent``` into your terminal, and then you can easily choose which branch to checkout.
